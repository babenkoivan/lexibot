# Lexibot

**Lexibot** is a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bot written on Go, which makes it very easy to add unknown words in 
the language you learn to your dictionary. You can see how it works below, or you can try it yourself by starting a new 
conversation with [@TheLexibot](https://t.me/TheLexibot).

### 1. Configure the languages 

When you start a conversation, **Lexibot** asks you to configure your language preferences: the language you wish to 
learn and the interface language.

### 2. Add words to your dictionary

When the initial setup is complete, you can send a word or a phrase to **Lexibot** to add it to your dictionary. The bot 
will try to automatically translate the input and if it is not possible, it will ask you to clarify the translation.
You can turn off the auto-translation functionality in the settings.
